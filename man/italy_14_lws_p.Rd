\title{Sample Individual-Level LWS Dataset (1,000 Rows)}
\format{
Data frame with 1,000 rows and 133 columns.
}
\usage{
italy_14_lws_p
}
\description{
This dataset provides individual-level data from the LWS database with 1,000 rows,
designed for exploration and user interaction. It is automatically loaded with
\code{lissyuse_locally()} whenever Italy is selected along with at least one individual-level
variable (e.g., "age") and the \code{lws} argument is set to \code{TRUE}.
}
\details{
The primary purpose of this dataset, and the \code{lissyuse_locally()} function, is to allow
users to build and test code locally, simulating its execution before running it on LISSY
(the LIS user interface) using the \code{lissyuse()} function.
